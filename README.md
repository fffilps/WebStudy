# WebStudy

## Study for those tricky Front-End Web Developer interview questions.

#### Only works on Google Chrome Desktop at the moment. I'll fix the code later. I have to move on to some other stuff.

Feel free to help me fix the code. 

Timeline:
- week 1 - finding all the answers and typing it all out. 
- week 2 - all of the coding to make it actually work. 
- Now - I'm looking at making other apps and projects.
